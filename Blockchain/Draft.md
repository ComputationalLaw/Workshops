# II. Hands-On, Project Based Experiential Learning: 

## A. Flash Design Team Projects: Quick Sketch Diagram and/or Rapid Prototype Demo 

### CHALLENGE: LINK SMART CONTRACT AND LEGAL CONTRACT PERTAINING TO THE SAME TRANSACTION

How to approach this exercise: 
* [Note: A brief information pack and project template will be provided to assist teams with quick generation and submission of diagram or demo projects]
* Break into teams of 2-3 people. For the following rapid demo expercise, first think through how to accomplish the task based on the information provided in the lectures and reading materials, as well as any information you already know or can quickly discover through Google and other sources.
* For Technology Aspects of Your Solution, Please Include the Names and Links to Each Specific Tool or Solution You Would Use to Solve the Challenge (eg: the Apps/Products/Services/Libraries/Algorithms/Standards/Etc).  Highlight Each Aspect of Your Solution that Pertains to Business and/or Legal Dimensions of the Transaction. 


### 1. Assuming Public Key Cryptography IS Used to Digitally Sign a Legal Contract:

* Show How a Party Can Use the Same Private Key to Digitally Sign a Legal Contract and Smart Contract Pertaining to the Same Transaction

### 2. Assume Public Key Cryptography IS NOT Used to Digitally Sign a Legal Contract

* Show How to Link Parties, Provisions and Processes of a Legal Contract and Smart Contract Pertaining to the Same Transaction


## B. Scenario-Based Team Projects: Role-Play and/or Write Transcript for a Simple Mock Trial 

### CHALLENGE: ESTABLISH OR PREVENT ADMISSIBILITY OF SMART CONTRACT INTO EVIDENCE

* How to approach this exercise: 
* [Note: A brief information pack and project template will be provided with a generic transcript and standard documentary evidence in plain text format to assist teams with rapid development and delivery of the project]
* Break into teams of 3-5 people.  First think through the basic rules defining admissible evidence provided as part of the the lectures and reading materials, as well as any information you already know or can quickly discover through Google and other sources.
* Make sure all content is assigned to a Roles and at minimum to use the Roles for "Litigator", "Business Records Witness" and "Technology Expert Witness"


### 1. Prove the Evidentiary Admissibility of a Smart Contract**

* With a written script or by demonstration, show the testimony necessary to lay the foundation necessary for a smart contract to be into evidence as proof of facts

### 2. Prevent Evidentiary Admissibility of a Smart Contract into Evidence**

* With a written script or by demonstration, show the testimony and/or objections necessary to prevent a smart contract from being entered into evidence.
