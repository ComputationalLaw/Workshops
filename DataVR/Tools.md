# Simmetri Description

Simmetri is a virtual playground and engine designed to let artists explore, design and create interactive experiences for VR. At its core, the application features a unique user interface designed to give creators a fast and fun way to prototype and produce experiences both game-like and nongame-like such as interactive music videos or data visualizations. Simmetri also has lots of stuff to play with without requiring coding skills such as timelines for keyframing, realtime physics, terrain, material editors, post-process effects, music visualizers and much more. For the more adventurous, there's a scripting layer underneath for more complex interactions and game mechanics. Simmetri is also a great way to learn and explore how VR is made from both the artistic side and coding side.

Simmetri works with the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and standard monitors/projectors. It is also compatible with Xbox, Oculus Touch, Vive and Midi controllers. It can import most common 3D, texture and sound file formats. It can export 360Â° videos for mobile as well as bundled self-running applications for interactive experiences.

Requirements: PC with 64bit Windows 10 and at least 8GB of RAM. A discrete GPU (NVIDIA or AMD) is highly recommended and required for using the editor in VR.
